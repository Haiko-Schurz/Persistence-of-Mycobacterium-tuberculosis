This repository contains the scripts to produce the analysis and figures for the following publication:

Persistence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in response to infection burden and host-induced stressors (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36530432/)

  As infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis progresses, the bacilli experience various degrees of host stressors in the macrophage phagosome such as low pH, nutrient deprivation, or exposure     to toxic agents, which promotes cell-to-cell phenotypic variation. This includes a physiologically viable but non- or slowly replicating persister subpopulation, which is characterised by a       loss of growth on solid media, while remaining metabolically active. Persisters additionally evade the host immune response and macrophage antimicrobial processes by adapting their metabolic      pathways to maintain survival and persistence in the host.

Four scripts are provided:
1. Bacterial_count_analysis.R: Used for the analysis and figures to compare the bacterial numbers across all the timepoints included in the experiment
2. Metbolic activity analysis .R: Used for the analysis of the metabolic activity of all groups across all the timepoints included in the experiment
3. Inhibitor counts .R: Used for the analysis and figures to compare the bacterial numbers across all the timepoints included in the experiment with two different inhibitors
4. Inhibitor metabolic activity .R: Used for the analysis of the metabolic activity of all groups across all the timepoints included in the experiment with two different inhibitors
